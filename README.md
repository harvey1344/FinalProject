# FinalProject
The code for my CMP 3rd year final project. To act as supporting material for my project portfolio.
This repository contains all the code, data and visualisations. All the code should be ran using the jupiter notebooks,
and to avoid any data issues, inconsistencies please ensure they are ran in order. 
The folder `own_algoithms` contains implimentation of my algorithms using  `algobase` calss from the `Surprise` libray,
in this folder can also be found an assortment of helper functions that are referenced in the portfolio and neccassary for
my project to run. 

Please note, most of the paramater optimisations take place in the notebooks however the matrix factorisation models required
extreme computational power and therefore was outsourced to py files to be ran on better processing power. Notably SVDpp took between
12-20 hours to run on a Ryzen 1700X 100% on 16 virtual cores so please run at your own risk.
